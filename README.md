# Redux Punch MUI
## What is Redux Punch MUI?

* Redux punch mui is a project recipe bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then all the goodies of redux, react-redux, react-router-dom, redux-persist, redux-thunk and reselect are added. 
* Clean ux interface integration with [material ui](https://mui.com/) is done.

## Why Redux Punch?

* Inspired by Convention Over Configuration Approach (COCA), Redux Punch provides some default convention using which ui application development becomes a breeze.
* Users of Redux Punch do not need to know all the inner details how the frameworks work but can follow a simple convention to make everything work.

## How to use the framework?
The framework has 6 folders under src

* actions - where all redux actions are declared
* reducers - where all redux states are decided using the previously defined actions
* store - where all the reducers are declared for saving the state in a redux store
* thunks - contains actions that fetch data from APIs and create or update the state by dispatching to reducers to manage states
* selectors - where data from state is returned to the ui components without ui components knowing about how to fetch state data
* components - where all react ui components reside, you can use material ui out of the box to create ui components here

### Adding a new action

Adding a new action is very simple

* Add a new actions file in the actions folder say 'mynewaction.js'
* Include your new action in the file
```js
export const MY_NEW_ACTION = "MY_NEW_ACTION";

export const myNewAction = () => ({
    type: MY_NEW_ACTION
});

```
* You can continue to add more actions to the same file or create new files as per your requirement

### Adding a new reducer

* Add a new reducer file in the reducers folder say 'myreducers.js'
* Include your new reducer in the file, should work in most of the cases
```js
import {
    MY_NEW_ACTION,
} from "../../actions/mynewaction";

export const myNewAction = (state = "", action) => {
    const { type, payload } = action;
    switch (type) {
        case MY_NEW_ACTION:
            return payload;
        default:
            return state;
    }
};
```
* You can continue to import more actions and add more reducers to the same file or create new files as per your requirement

### Adding the reducer to the store
* Import your new reducer in the store.js file and include the same in the reducers object
```js
import { myNewAction } from "../reducers/myreducers";

...

const reducers = {
    ...
    myNewAction
};

```

### Adding Thunks to fetch data
* Add the logic to fetch your data and dispatch to the new reducers created to update the state. A typical method in thunk is as shown below. Create a new thunk 'mynewthunk.js' and continue adding your logic
```js
import {
    myNewAction
} from "../../actions/mynewaction";


export const fetchData = () => async (dispatch) => {
    try {
        dispatch(startLoading());
        const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/api/endpoint`, {
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            },
            method: "get",
        });
        const responseData = await response.json();
        if (response.status === 200) {
            dispatch(myNewAction(responseData));
        } else {
            dispatch(
                displayMessage(
                    "Could not fetch the data successfully."
                )
            );
        }
        dispatch(stopLoading());
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
        dispatch(
            displayMessage(
                "Error occurred. Retry action."
            )
        );
        dispatch(stopLoading());
    }
};
```
### Adding selector to get data
* Create a new selector say 'mynewselector.js' in the selector dir and add the actions to fetch data from the state
```js
export const getDataFromState = state => {
    return state.myNewData;
};

```
### Adding a new component

* Create new components and bind the state and actions as shown below. Note the 'connect' method that connects the state and dispatch with the components
```js
import React from "react";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
import { getDataFromState } from "../../selectors/mynewselector";
import { fetchData } from "../../thunks/mynewthunk";

const MyNewComponent = ({ myNewData }) => {
    return (
        {myNewData} // you can use your data here
    );
};

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
    myNewData: getDataFromState(state)
});

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
    getNewDataOnButtonClick: () => {
        dispatch(fetchData());
    }
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyNewComponent);

```

## Setting up the Project

* Pull the source code and cd to redux-punch dir.
```
git clone https://github.com/vensr/redux-punch.git
```
* Install all dependencies
```
yarn install
```
* Start the app
```
yarn start
```
* Access the app at http://localhost:3000
* You can then modify the code to suit your needs or take inspiration from the code to do whatever you wish to

## Try using Docker

Try running the app without setting up any code

* Pull docker image
```
docker pull venkatesh5/redux-punch
```
* Run the image
```
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 venkatesh5/redux-punch
```

## Running in Production

The project contains a docker file that can be used to build the docker image to run in production. 

* Build the image using
```
docker build -t redux-punch .
```
* Run the built image using 
```
docker run -it -p 3000:3000 redux-punch
```
* Access the app at the http://localhost:3000

* To deploy the application on Kubernetes and ArgoCD check [redux-punch-deploy](https://github.com/vensr/redux-punch-deploy)
